        <p>This portfolio is the Graphics Town &ldquo;project&rdquo; from the regular 559 class. It&rsquo;s become a tradition in class with a long history. Graphics town is an opportunity for students to show off the stuff they&rsquo;ve learned in class.</p>
<p>For this assignment, there is only one big box: Graphics Town. It can be found on a separate page (
    
    <a href="../../for_students/gr-01-01.html" class="for_students for_students--notfile">gr-01-01.html</a>) - as well as on <a href="./docs/1/">Page &nbsp;1&nbsp; (Graphics Town)</a>.</p>
<p>Rather than a lot of small boxes, this assignment has a single, big window. In said window, you should create a 3D world of your choosing with as much creativity as you want.</p>
<p>We realize that you have limited time to do this so we&rsquo;ve tried to make our expectations as reasonable as possible.</p>
<p>In the regular class, the assignment gets quite complex with grading requirements. For the honors section, things are simplified. &ldquo;A&quot;s are obvious (you can look at them and tell that they are &ldquo;good enough&rdquo;) and the rest are &ldquo;not-yet-As&rdquo;. If your assignment isn&rsquo;t obviously an A in the regular class, it&rsquo;s not an A for the honors section.</p>
<p>That being said, we&rsquo;ve included the regular section&rsquo;s grading details so that you can get ideas from them and treat them like guidelines for what an &ldquo;A&rdquo; grade looks like.</p>
<p>We also recommend that you look at some examples from recent years. The <a href="https://pages.graphics.cs.wisc.edu/559-sp23/gallery/grtowngallery/">2023 Galleries</a> are a good start since you can actually try them out. Other years have similar assignments (but usually just pictures): <a href="https://pages.graphics.cs.wisc.edu/559-sp24/gallery/p2/">2024</a>, <a href="https://pages.graphics.cs.wisc.edu/559-sp22/gallery/galleryfinal/">2022</a>, <a href="https://pages.graphics.cs.wisc.edu/559-sp21/gallery/wb12/">2021</a>, <a href="https://pages.graphics.cs.wisc.edu/559-sp19//graphics-town-gallery/">2019</a>.</p>
<p>We do recommend that you read through all pages of this &ldquo;workbook&rdquo; - it has useful ways to think about the assignment. Even though the grading details don&rsquo;t apply, they can give you ideas.</p>
<p>We <strong>encourage</strong> honors students to share things (use objects/behaviors from other students). Your world must be your own, but it can have things from others (just make sure to cite where you got the objects/behaviors from).</p>
<h2 id="requirements-and-evaluation">Requirements and Evaluation</h2>
<p>The regular assignment (over the next few pages) gives lots of details. But the things to focus on are:</p>
<ol>
<li>The UI still works and things run at a reasonable speed.</li>
<li>You have a complex enough world with enough objects.</li>
<li>The world looks intentional - there is some theme or concept behind it (it&rsquo;s not just a random assortment of stuff).</li>
<li>You have interesting behaviors and motions in the world.</li>
<li>You use the UI elements (highlighting, lookat, riding) to show off the cool objects.</li>
<li>There are some things that are &ldquo;technically advanced&rdquo; (see <a href="./docs/5/">Page &nbsp;5&nbsp; (Graphics Town Advanced Things)</a>)</li>
<li>There is a shader that you wrote</li>
</ol>
<p>It should be obvious to the viewer that all these criteria are met.</p>
