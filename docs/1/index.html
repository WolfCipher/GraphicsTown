Document what you do on <a href="../../docs/2/">Page  2  (Graphics Town Overview)</a>. If it&rsquo;s cool, you&rsquo;ll get a good grade.</p>
<p>This is 
    
    <a href="../../for_students/gr-01-01.html" class="for_students for_students--notfile">gr-01-01.html</a> embedded on the page (so it gets chopped off). We&rsquo;ll look at that page to assess it.</p>

        Welcome to the Village of All Seasons, where each corner of the village experiences a different season.
    </p>

    <p>
        Special Interactions:
        <br> (1) Use the (b) key to follow a bird's eye view.
        <br> (2) Manipulate the forklift with (w,a,s,d) keys for position, (q,e) for rotation, and (r,f) for fork height.
        <br> (3) Manipulate the bulldozer with (i,j,k,l) keys for position, (u,o) for rotation, (y,h) for arm height, (t,g) for head rotation.
    </p>

        There are quite a few things influenced by sine noise:
        <br>(1) the trees' sizes and positions
        <br>(2) the sizes of the snow drifts
        <br>(3) the positions of the snowflakes
        <br>(4) the sizes of all the flowers except the "radar dish flowers" that track the bugs
        <br>(5) the positions of some flowers
        <br> Note that the positions that are influenced by the sine noise would otherwise have lain in a circle. So, while the positions may not appear truly random, this was intentional so that I could have control over the positions while still having some randomness.

<p><strong>Why is there a long version?</strong> Students often want to know &ldquo;how much do I need to make?&rdquo; Or &ldquo;how cool does it have to be?&rdquo; But, we want to make things be flexible because students can be <strong>very</strong> creative, and we want to encourage that.</p>
<p>The hard part is quantifying “enough” and “cool”. We might say “you’ll know it when you see it.” But instead, we have to try to write something…</p>
<p>There are a bunch of pages explaining what you should do.</p>
<p>Remember:</p>
<ol>
<li><del>You must document (in <strong>p2-workbook.txt</strong>) what you do in order to get credit.</del> You can document what you have done in the &ldquo;student box&rdquo; on this page.</li>
<li>Add any files that you create to the repository.</li>
<li>Push early and often - it provides a backup in case something goes wrong.</li>
<li>Be aware of the collaboration policy.</li>
<li>Keep the user interface on 
    
    <a href="../../for_students/final-grtown.html" class="for_students for_students--notfile">final-grtown.html</a> - you can add things to it, but we need the functions to work.</li>
<li>Be careful to keep performance reasonable, and not to make your repository be too huge.</li>
<li>Complete the Canvas Assignment when you are done (and have committed and pushed)</li>
</ol>
<p>Within the workbook, there is 
    
    <a href="../../for_students/gr-01-01.html" class="for_students for_students--notfile">gr-01-01.html</a> page and its associated 
    
    <a href="../../for_students/gr-01-01.js" class="for_students for_students--notfile">gr-01-01.js</a>. This is where your town goes. There is also an <code>examples</code> directory, which gives you some sample stuff to get started.</p>
<p>We have given you a basic &ldquo;world&rdquo; to start. It is really more of a collection of random objects than a &ldquo;town.&rdquo; You may use these objects in your town, but you should arrange things in a more meaningful manner. In fact, you should not use the <code>main</code> function that we provide as an example. Note that one of the &ldquo;basic requirements&rdquo; is that your assignment &ldquo;is visually distinct from the example provided.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You need to highlight some of <strong>your</strong> objects. As an example, we have highlighted some of our objects - but you can only highlight objects that you created. Be sure to remove the highlighting of our objects.</p>
